# Hack Recursive Function Stack Overflow
This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error caused by a recursive function.  The function `foo` calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. If a large number is passed to the function, it will exceed the maximum recursion depth, resulting in a stack overflow error.
The solution demonstrates how to handle this by adding a check for the maximum recursion depth.
